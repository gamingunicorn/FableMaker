    <h1>Tutorial</h1>
    <p>On this website, you can create your own fables by selecting two animals,
         one setting, and a moral. In each story, Animal 1 is the main character
          who encounters a problem or challenge. Animal 2, on the other hand, is
           both the cause of the problem and the one who helps resolve it, providing 
           the answer or lesson to be learned. You also choose one setting—such as a 
           forest, a village, or a mountain—that serves as the backdrop for the story.
            Finally, you select a moral that ties the fable together, offering a lesson
             about life, behavior, or values. With these elements, you can generate a 
             unique fable every time, combining different animals, settings, and morals
              to create a new story with a meaningful message.</p>
